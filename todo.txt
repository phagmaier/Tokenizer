1. String class and can read the file pretty accuratley 
2. Splits on things you're supposed to split on and includes them

                        TODO 
                      -------- 
1. Now instead of words you split into tokens  
2. Start with each pair of bytes (chars)
3. Need a custom hashmap
  - hashmap will include tokens (either string or int)
  - will include a count 
  - will have a sorted list of counts 
  - each token will also have a list of pairs(indexes to where they can be found)

ACTUALLY YOU MAY WANT A HASHMAP WHERE EACH ELEMENT ALSO CONTAINS A POINTER TO 
IT'S LEFT AND RIGHT TOKEN TO MAKE IT EASIER TO RECOMPUTE COUNTS LATER 

JUST KEEP A SORTED LIST AND KEEP TRACK OF IT'S SIZE AS YOU MERGE AND COMPRESS 
CAN USE BINARY SEARCH TO FIND THE COUNT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TO REMOVE THEN 
'SHRINK THE SIZE' DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TO SHRINK but just dec the count
